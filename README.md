## 💻Dataset

Through the process of re-labeling, we obtain an attention-based driving event dataset (ADED) consisting of 1101 videos. The dataset provides semantic annotation for each driving video, and the semantic information contains annotations of driving event categories and driving event time windows. The driving event categories contain six categories, which are Driving Normally (DN), Avoiding Pedestrian Crossing (ACP) Waiting for Vehicle Ahead (WVA), Waiting for Red Light (SRL), Stop Sign Stopping (SSS) and Avoiding Lane Changing Vehicle (ALC).

<b>Fig. 1. ADED dataset annotation process</b>. On the left is the annotation process for the entire ADED dataset. The heatmaps are derived from the BDD-A dataset, captured through eye-tracking devices to represent driver’s attention. On the right is the annotation process for event time windows of driving event.

<div align="left">
<b>Fig. 3. Perception-inspired Network (VP²Net).</b> Our model takes driving video sequences as input, where the SIE branch extracts bottom-up driving scene information and the APE branch extracts top-down driver attention information (which undergoes attention perception — “where to focus”, attention enhancement — “when to focus”, and information encoding). Subsequently, attention information guides the fusion of driving scene features, further decoded to produce the output. F1 is the attention information encoder. F2 is the event information decoder.
